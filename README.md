### Hello, my name is Alexander French but if you've made it this far you can call me Alex ðŸ˜‰

#### I am 29 years old and looking for my first job as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst. I am self-taught and hope to one day be a senior/project-lead Data Scientist and perhaps ML Engineer.

#### Feel free to have a look around and if you have any questions don't hesitate to get in touch.
